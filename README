# Collective Count

A little nasty client that shoots off to Twitter and Facebook (for now) and give you a collective count of how many times your content has been passed around the internet.

## Syntax

``` javascript
var url = 'http://www.google.com',
    service = ['twitter', 'facebook'],
    callback = function(count) { alert('You are ' + count 'x famous!'); };

collectivecount.get(url, services, callback);
```
